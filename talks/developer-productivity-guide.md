title: A Hitchhiker's Guide to Developer Productivity
date: 2024-09-17
abstract: This talk explores how Golden Paths and Software Templates can revolutionize developer productivity by providing prescribed, automated practices for common development tasks. Using "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" as a playful metaphor, Janina and I demonstrate how these standardized approaches can eliminate the maze of repetitive tasks, reduce cognitive overload, and cut lead times from 50 days to mere minutes. The presentation covers the what, why, and how of implementing Golden Paths, while emphasizing the importance of treating templates as user-centric products that must evolve with technology and align with organizational culture to truly transform the developer experience from chaos to clarity.
