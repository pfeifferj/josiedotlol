title: Would You Like Fries With That? AI for Developer Productivity
date: 2024-05-16
abstract: In this talk, Kyra and I showcased how we successfully integrated an AI-powered recommendation engine into Red Hat's Internal Developer Platform, based on Backstage.io, to enhance developer productivity. Our approach leverages data from the Developer Hub analytics API and processes it with Knative event-driven microservices to generate smart action proposals. Using OpenShift AI, we train and deploy AI models that power a frontend plugin in the Developer Hub, providing tailored recommendations directly to users powered by ML-Ops pipelines. By leveraging the power of AI, we have improved the developer experience by providing personalized suggestions for tools, resources, and tutorials, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency.
